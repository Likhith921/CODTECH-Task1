### Project Name: Todo List

The Todo List App is a simple, interactive task management application designed to help users organize and track their to-do lists effectively. This application provides an intuitive interface that allows users to add, filter, and track tasks with ease.

### Key Features:

1. **Task Addition**: Users can add new tasks by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button. This functionality enables users to quickly build their list of tasks.

2. **Task Filtering**: The app provides filtering options—"All," "Active," and "Completed"—which help users view their tasks based on their current status. This feature makes it easy to manage tasks at different stages.

3. **Progress Tracking**: The app includes a progress bar that dynamically updates as tasks are completed. The "Progress Stats" and "Progress Fill" elements give users a visual representation of their task completion, motivating them to complete remaining tasks.

4. **Responsive Design**: With a modern HTML structure and CSS styling, the app adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly experience across devices.

5. **Dynamic Task List**: Using JavaScript, tasks are dynamically managed and displayed, allowing users to interact with and update their to-do list without reloading the page.

This project is a practical tool for managing daily tasks and can be expanded to include features like task prioritization, due dates, and local storage for persisting tasks across sessions.
